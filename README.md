# Simulation-of-Multi-Processor-Scheduling--RR-and-FCFS-

Simulation of Multi Processor Scheduling (Round Robin combined with First Come First Served) in C language

When a process enters Ready Queue for CPU processing, OS schedules the peocess.
Here two schedulings are simulated.
First the process is scheduled using Round Robin Scheduling technique and after that to improve the scheduling the process is scheduled using First Come First Served Scheduler.
